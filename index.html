Welcome to my blog's `127.0.0.1`, as most developers I pass a huge chunk of my time reading code and manuals, and when I find or do something interesting enough to share it, I post it in here (Mostly for my own learning). If you want to know more about this blog check out the [About](/about/) page. I hope what you find here is useful for you as well.

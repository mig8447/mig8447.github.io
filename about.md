I decided to start this blog while I was experimenting with GitHub. I've been involved in all kinds of software development projects: small, big, front-end, backend, IoT, mobile etc. and I've had to learn (And re-learn from time to time) lots of things on my own, looking for docs and examples on every corner of the Internet and although there are tons of good posts about almost anything you can imagine, I've sometimes felt **there's something missing**, sometimes a simple example, sometimes a not-so-simple one, or simply a usecase.

This blog is a complement to all those missing things and the repository where I *should* come back to quick-re-learn all of the things I've put in here. I hope it can be useful for others too.

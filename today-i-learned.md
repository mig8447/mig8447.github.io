This section is inspired on the [Today I Learned](https://til.hashrocket.com/) project from Hashrocket. I liked the overall concept of having fequent posts about something someone learned during the day, specially because the folks at Hashrocket use it mostly for software development posts. There's an open source project from them called [Tilex](https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex) which can be forked/downloaded by anyone who wants to replicate their "TIL" site, but since I already had this blog, I decided to take the concept and develop it here.
